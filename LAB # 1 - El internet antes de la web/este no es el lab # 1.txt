50 Zork: Hell
It is pitch black.  You are likely to be eaten by a grue.

Oh, no!  You walked into the slavering fangs of a lurking grue.
As you take your last breath, you feel relieved of your burdens. The feeling passes as you find yourself before the gate
s of Hell, where the
spirits jeer at you and deny you entry.  Your senses are disturbed.  The objects in the dungeon appear indistinct, bleac
hed of color, even
unreal.
The room looks strange and unearthly and objects appear indistinct.
Entrance to Hades
You are outside a large gateway, on which is inscribed
        "Abandon every hope, all ye who enter here."
The gate is open; through it you can see a desolation, with a pile of mangled corpses in one corner.  Thousands of voice
s, lamenting some
hideous fate, can be heard.
The way through the gate is barred by evil spirits, who jeer at your attempts to pass.
